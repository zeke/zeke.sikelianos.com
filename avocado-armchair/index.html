      <p>I met <a href="https://fir.sh/">Ben Firshman</a> in Berkeley in the spring of 2021. He was starting a new company called <a href="https://replicate.com">Replicate</a> with his friend and former colleague <a href="https://github.com/andreasjansson">Andreas Jansson</a>, with the goal of making machine learning more accessible to software engineers. They knew I’d worked on a lot of “make hard stuff easy” projects like <a href="https://zeke.sikelianos.com/swagger/">Swagger</a>, <a href="https://zeke.sikelianos.com/heroku/">Heroku</a>, <a href="https://zeke.sikelianos.com/npm/">npm</a>, and <a href="https://zeke.sikelianos.com/electron-nativefier/">Electron</a>, and they wanted me to join their new company as the first employee. I didn’t have any experience with machine learning at the time, but I could see these two bright and bushy-tailed hackers had twinkles in their eyes. They’d been around the block and seemed to have a tingling spidey-sense that AI was about to be a really big deal.</p>
<p>But I was still skeptical. I had experienced some of the magic of AI through tools like <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">GitHub Copilot</a>, a programming assistant with an uncanny ability to autocomplete my code as I wrote it. But the state of AI-powered image generation at the time was still pretty unimpressive to me. Ben and Andreas were so excited about <a href="https://www.fabianmosele.com/ai-timeline">early text-to-image models</a> but to me, most of that that stuff mostly looked like <a href="https://replicate.com/blog/painting-with-words-a-history-of-text-to-image-ai">incomprehensible piles of eyeballs</a>, and I just didn’t get what all the fuss was about.</p>
<p>But then they showed me DALL·E, a brand new image generation model from OpenAI. Unlike <a href="https://www.fabianmosele.com/ai-timeline">everything that came before it</a>, OpenAI’s new model could take a text prompt and generate high quality images, even of never-before-seen things like “an avocado in the shape of an armchair”.</p>
<p>I remember the moment I saw my first avocado armchair. I was in Replicate’s Berkeley office, a lovely sunlit space in an old brick building, perched above the <a href="https://www.thehiddencafe.life/">Hidden Cafe</a> and the Strawberry Creek Park. Ben was sitting at his computer, and I was leaning over his shoulder as he pulled up the DALL·E website. The images of the avocado armchair were striking. What was this sorcery? How could a computer program conjure these kinds of novel images from the ether?</p>
<p>These avocado armchairs showed me how much the worlds of software, design, art, and visual communication were about to change forever. I was finally starting to see what Ben and Andreas were so excited about. So, in the fall of 2021, I left my cushy job at GitHub and joined the Replicate team.</p>
<p>Ben and I share a love of junk joints and found items, and Replicate’s Berkeley office was a testament to that. Much of the furniture and decor for the space was sourced from places like <a href="https://urbanore.com/">Urban Ore</a> and the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/wD49WBXAKhBwwrqV8">El Cerrito Recycling Center</a>, and some of it was even found right on the street, including our very own dining table and a set of “avocado armchairs”. For me, these real-life avocado armchairs were a token of many of our company’s shared ideals: artistic expression, creative reuse, and absurdity.</p>
<p>Now it’s two years later, and a lot of what we envisioned in the early days of Replicate has come to pass. Replicate has grown a lot, largely because of Ben and Andreas's foresight about the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Aug/29/stable-diffusion/">"Stable Diffusion moment"</a>, an important milestone in recent AI history when open-source image generation models started to rival the capabilities of closed-source models like OpenAI's DALL·E. More AI development is happening in the open, with companies like Meta and Stability open-sourcing their models so the community can experiment and use them in unexpected new ways. There are now <a href="https://replicate.com/collections/text-to-image">scores of open-source image generation models</a>, all of them capable of rendering avocado armchairs with much higher fidelity than what we saw from OpenAI’s closed-source model.</p>
<p>Replicate is growing up. We now have a team of more than 30 people, and we're building a product used by millions of people. Part of that growth means we're moving out of our Berkeley office and into a new space in San Francisco. I'm sad to say goodbye to our avocado armchairs, but I'm excited to see what the future holds for Replicate and the world of AI.</p>
