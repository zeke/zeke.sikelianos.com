Acrophonic alphabets are a system for clearly and unambiguously communicating letters of the alphabet over voice communication channels. Born from the necessity to avoid confusion caused by similar-sounding letters – particularly in noisy or challenging environments like radio transmissions, telephone calls, and even across language barriers – these alphabets assign a unique codeword to each letter, like Alpha for A, Bravo for B, and Charlie for C.

The NATO alphabet is the most well-known of the acrophonic alphabets, but there are hundreds of variations in use by different organizations around the world for aviation, maritime industries, emergency services, and any field requiring precise verbal transmission of alphanumeric information.

Acrophony is a website for spelling over the phone or walkie-talkie, in Alpha-Bravo-Charlie style.
