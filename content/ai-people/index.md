Here's a list of my favorite educators from the world of AI-powered software development.
These people are gifted communicators: they have the ability to understand complex topics and explain them in ways that are both clear and engaging.

## Page Bailey

Paige works on AI stuff at Google. She's very funny, very smart, and shared a lot of timely and useful content.

## Andrej Karpathy

Andrej has worked at OpenAI a couple times, and used to be the head of AI at Tesla. He has that special combination of deep technical knowledge and the ability to describe things simply and understandably.

## Simon Willison

Simon is an independent software engineer and journalist, and maybe the most prolific tech writer I follow. He's kinda famous for being a co-creator of the Django web framework for Python.

He experiments a lot with language models, pushing them to their limits, and building open-source tools for experimentation.

Simon maintains an old-fashioned blog. Remember those? You know, like a website with words and dates on it. No algorith. No feed. Just posts.

## Daniel Shiffman

Daniel is an engaging lecturer. He's the creator of the Coding Train YouTube channel, which is a great resource for learning to code.

He wrote a book called [The Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/) which is a great introduction to programming and the physical world.
