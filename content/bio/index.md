I grew up in a family of <a href="http://beaver.zeke.sikelianos.com/">artists and artisans</a>, and
though I ended up in a [technical field](/github), I still consider design to an essential part of my work. I believe that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic">information wants to be free</a>, and the work I do is always in the service of that idea.

Today I'm a software developer at <a href="https://github.com/about">GitHub</a>, working on <a href="http://electron.atom.io">Electron</a>, an open-source project for building native applications using open web technologies like HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

I love to travel. In the last five years I've moved a lot, from Los Angeles to Paris to San Francisco to Oakland to New Orleans to Santa Barbara, and most recently to Moorpark, CA. I live with my wife <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nelbo_/">Jenelle</a> and our sons <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/6IUj0eFvFU/?taken-by=nelbo">Cosmos</a>
and
<a href="https://cloudup.com/cF8ek7Pbn5C">Rowan</a>.

<!-- My resolution for 2016 was to channel Ganesha, the "remover of obstacles".

My resolution for 2017 is to learn more about building the immutable decentralized Internet of the future, moving control of information sharing from corporations to individuals. -->
