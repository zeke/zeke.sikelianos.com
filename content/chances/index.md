[Chances With Wolves](http://www.chanceswithwolves.com/) is a weekly
radio show that plays really good old funky music. Lots of Beatles covers and
psychedelic retro stuff. I wrote a bookmarklet that modifies the
chanceswithwolves.com website, adding links to YouTube and Google searches for
each song.
