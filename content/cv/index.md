## Work History

### Replicate

_Founding Designer - 2021-Present_

[Replicate](https://replicate.com) is a platform for building and running AI models in the cloud. We make [open-source](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/open-source) [tools](https://cog.run) used by engineers, researchers, and tinkerers to package, deploy, and run machine learning models at scale. We're also a community where people share and publish models. As the first employee, I've worked as a designer, engineer, and developer advocate to build Replicate's [website](https://replicate.com), [model playground](https://replicate.com/playground), [HTTP API](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http), [SDKs](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/client-libraries), [demos](https://x.com/zeke/status/1937267796146290952), and [documentation](https://replicate.com/docs/get-started/fine-tune-with-flux). My focus is on developer experience, creating tools and content that make it easier for people to build software with AI.

### GitHub

_Staff Software Engineer - 2016-2021_

[GitHub](https://github.com) is where the world builds software. In my five years as an engineer at GitHub, I helped launch [Electron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNHBfN8c32U), the open-source tool for building desktop apps, which has become the basis for apps like Slack, VS Code, and Cursor. On the Electron team, I internationalized [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/blog/new-website), added [Typescript support](https://www.electronjs.org/blog/typescript), and helped manage an active community of international open-source contributors. After Electron, I founded GitHub's first docs engineering team. We [launched](https://github.blog/2020-07-01-launching-docs-github-com/) docs.github.com, [internationalized](https://github.blog/2019-09-16-product-documentation-now-available-in-spanish/) docs.github.com, [open-sourced](https://github.blog/2020-10-14-how-we-open-sourced-docs-github-com/) docs.github.com, and co-created the [OpenAPI description](https://github.blog/2020-07-27-introducing-githubs-openapi-description/) for GitHub's REST API.

### npm

_Designer, Developer - 2014-2015_

[npm](https://npmjs.org/~zeke) is the package manager for JavaScript​: a registry of over <strike>1 million</strike> 3.5 million open-source "lego blocks" for building applications for Node.js and the browser. For over ten years, npm has been the default tool and registry to publish and consume open-source software for the web. During my time as an early employee at npm, I helped redesign and rebuild the frontend and backend of [the new npmjs.com website](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/104856015780/npm-has-a-new-website), making it faster, mobile-friendly, and [more welcoming to contributors](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/109508231330/nicely-presented-markup).

### Heroku

_Product Designer, Buildpack maintainer - 2012-2014_

[Heroku](https://heroku.com) is a platform that simplifies the process of deploying, running, and scaling web applications. I wore many hats at Heroku, including designer, engineer, product manager, and open-source advocate. I designed and implemented a [redesign of addons.heroku.com](https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2012/12/4/new-addons-site), Heroku's marketplace for cloud infrastructure providers, as well as other web properties like blog.heroku.com and help.heroku.com. In my last year with the company, I spent most of my time improving the [Node.js development experience](https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2013/12/10/new-node-buildpack) on Heroku by rewriting the build process, creating the [semver.io microservice](http://localhost:4000/semver.io) for resolving Node versions, writing documentation and [blog posts](/#posts), supporting customers, representing the company at conferences, and mentoring at meetups.

### Wordnik

_Designer, Developer, Neolexicographer - 2011-2012_

[Wordnik](https://wordnik.com) was a startup with the ambitious goal of becoming the world's largest English dictionary, and of course we had an API. I worked with a diverse team of computer scientists and linguists to design, build, and maintain the high-traffic wordnik.com Ruby on Rails web application. I also co-created [Swagger](https://zeke.sikelianos.com/swagger) and Swagger UI (now OpenAPI), a specification and set of open-source tooling that has become the de facto standard for documenting and consuming HTTP web services.

### Fractured Atlas

_Designer, Developer - 2009-2011_

[Fractured Atlas](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/) is a national non-profit organization providing services for the independent arts community. At Fractured Atlas I designed, coded, and maintained Ruby on Rails and Sinatra applications and geospatial webservices using technologies like Postgres, PostGIS, CouchDB, and the Google Maps Javascript and Flash SDKs.

### ELC

_Developer - 2007-2009_

ELC Technologies was a consultancy providing services to Fortune 500 companies in the early days of Ruby on Rails and Amazon Web Services. At ELC, I was introduced to Unix, macOS, Ruby, and cloud computing. I led the development and maintenance of websites for big enterprises, using popular practices of agile web development like pair programming and iterative development cycles.

### Ideum

In partnership with the French department at the University of New Mexico, I joined a teaching program and moved to L'Isle sur la Sorgue, Provence, France to teach American English language and culture at Lycée Polyvalent Alphonse Benoit.

### Neogenesis Media

_Guru Factotum - 2000-2001_
