ELC was a Rails development consultancy for Fortune 500 companies. As a developer at ELC I oversaw the design, development, and maintenance of enterprise-level applications, and was introduced to the now-popular practice of agile web development, including pair programming, scrum management, daily checkins, and iterative development cycles.
