Fractured Atlas is a national non-profit organization providing services for the independent arts community. During my tenure at Gemini, I designed, coded, and maintained Rails and Sinatra applications and geospatial webservices making use of technologies like Postgres, PostGIS, CouchDB, and the Google Maps Javascript and Flash SDKs.
