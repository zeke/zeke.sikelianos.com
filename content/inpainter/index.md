Inpainting is the process of using AI image generation models to erase and repaint parts of existing images.

Inpainter.app is an [open-source demo](https://github.com/replicate/inpainter) that uses the [Ideogram v2](https://replicate.com/ideogram-ai/ideogram-v2) and [Ideogram v2 Turbo](https://replicate.com/ideogram-ai/ideogram-v2-turbo) machine learning models and [Replicate's API](https://replicate.com) to inpaint images right in your browser.
