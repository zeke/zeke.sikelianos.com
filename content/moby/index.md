[Moby Thesaurus](http://moby-thesaurus.org) is a free and open-source website for searching the [largest thesaurus in the English language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby_Project). The thesaurus itself has been around since the early 1990s, but until recently its content was only available on [clickbaity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickbait) websites with terrible interfaces and lots of banner ads. In 2014, I set out to change that by creating  [moby-thesaurus.org](http://moby-thesaurus.org). The site is fast, contains no ads, works well on mobile, and is [open-sourced on GithHub](https://github.com/zeke/moby).
