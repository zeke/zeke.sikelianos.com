Neogenesis was a documentary Ô¨Ålm production house in downtown Albuquerque, New Mexico. I worked part-time while attending the University of New Mexico. My primary focus was post-video editing using Discreet Combustion and After Effects. I also produced interactive CD-ROMs and Macromedia (Adobe) Flash websites, and developed and maintained a networked rendering farm.
