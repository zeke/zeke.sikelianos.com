Outpainting is the process of using AI image generation models to expand and paint outside the boundaries of existing images. Outpainting is similar to [inpainting](/inpainter), but instead of replacing the _inside_ of an image, you replace the _outside_ edges.

Outpainter.app takes an image and a text prompt and then expands the canvas. The app was built in a day in collaboration with [@PontusAurdal](https://x.com/PontusAurdal) using Vue JS, Nust JS, and Tailwind CSS, and it's deployed on Vercel. ⚡️
