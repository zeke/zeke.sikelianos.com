Rome & Gold Creative was a branding agency working in a wide array of media. I worked as Lead Web Designer/Developer and Junior Print Designer, focusing primarily on developing MySQL-driven PHP websites with content management interfaces, but also doing print, clothing, environmental, and game design.
