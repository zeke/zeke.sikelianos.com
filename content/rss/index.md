## What is RSS?

RSS stands for **R**eally **S**imple **S**yndication.

It's a standardized way for websites to publish their content in a structured format, and for consumers of that content to easily subscribe to updates.

So, instead of manually checking your favorite websites for updates (or relying on algorithms to serve you a feed of curated content), you use an RSS reader and it brings new posts to you as they're published.

## How to Subscribe

If you don't already have a preferred RSS reader, here are some popular ones you can use to subscribe to the feed:

- [Feedly](https://feedly.com) (web + mobile)
- [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com) (web + mobile)
- [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com) (Mac + iOS)
- [Reeder](https://reederapp.com) (Mac + iOS)
- [NewsBlur](https://www.newsblur.com) (web + mobile)

Install one of these apps, then add the feed URL to start receiving updates whenever new content is posted:

```plaintext
{{ siteUrl }}/feed.xml
```
