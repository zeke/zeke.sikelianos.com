## What is RSS?

RSS stands for **R**eally **S**imple **S**yndication.

It's a standardized way for websites to publish their content in a structured format, and for consumers of that content to easily subscribe to updates.

So, instead of manually checking your favorite websites for updates (or relying on algorithms to serve you a feed of curated content), you use an RSS reader and it brings new posts to you as they're published.

## How to Subscribe

You can use RSS without installing anything by using an email-to-RSS service or a web-based reader.

### Option 1: Get updates by email (no app install)

- [Blogtrottr](https://blogtrottr.com): paste the feed URL, enter your email, choose a schedule (immediate or digest).
- [follow.it](https://follow.it): subscribe to the feed and choose email delivery (immediate, daily, or weekly).

### Option 2: Read in a browser (no app install)

- [Feedly](https://feedly.com/news-reader) (web + mobile)
- [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com) (web + mobile)
- [NewsBlur](https://www.newsblur.com) (web + mobile)

### Option 3: Apps

- [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com) (Mac + iOS)
- [Reeder](https://reederapp.com) (Mac + iOS)
