Fresh out of high school, I received a scholarship to attend the University of New Mexico in 1999. I changed my major several times, from philosophy to electrical engineering to media arts to French, and after two years of relative disenchantment, I enrolled in an [English teaching program in France](/france) and made what was to be my first exodus from academia and the United States.
