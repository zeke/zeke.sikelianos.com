Vibe coding is a new practice in software development where humans chat with AI language models that generate code. The human provides instructions using natural language (English, Spanish, Chinese, etc.) and the model generates code (JavaScript, Python, CSS, HTML, etc) to satisfy those requirements. It's an iterative process where human and machine work together to build and improve an app, website, game, tool, or document through a long-running conversational dialogue. The term "vibe coding" was [coined by Andrej Karpathy](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383) in early 2025.

To vibe code is to "give in to the vibes", disregarding the specific implementation details of the code you're generating, and instead improving your project through natural language prompts based on the results you see, rather than the inner workings of the code.



## The Popup

Along with friends Wendy Dherin and Jack Love, I co-hosted a [free popup event](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/creative-vibe-coding-workshop-tickets-1412862392449?aff=oddtdtcreator) at [Sudo Room](https://sudoroom.org/), a hackerspace in Oakland's Temescal district. We taught people how to vibe code!
