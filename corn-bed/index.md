title: The Corn Bed
description: A rejuvenating full-body experience

As a kid growing up in New Mexico, I loved visiting the State Fair every year. My favorite attraction was the giant box of dried corn kernels in a quiet corner of the agricultural building, beside the prizing-winning fruits and vegetables. Everyone was welcome to climb into the box and roll around in the corn to their heart's content. It was the full-body equivalent of dipping your hands into the bulk beans at the grocery store.

Lying in corn is profoundly relaxing and energizing. As the corn shifts to form a mold around your body, it creates a sensation of weightlessness. It's like floating in water without the latent fear of drowning.

Even as a young adult, I would relax among the kernels as little children played all around me with toy dump trucks, shovels, and buckets. I vowed to one day make myself a personal corn bed, and in 2010 I finally got around to doing it.
