I worked at this small architectural design firm as a high school student, photographing homes an creating websites to show them off to prospective buyers. The fun part was making panoramic 360-degree IPIX pictures using a camera equipped with a special 190-degree lens for taking twin hemispheric photos to stitch together with software.
