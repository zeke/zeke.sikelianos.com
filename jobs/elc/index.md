ELC was a Rails development consultancy for Fortune 500 companies. As a developer at ELC I oversaw the design, development, and maintenance of enterprise-level applications, and was exposed to newly-popularized tenets of so-called agile web development, including pair programming, scrum management and iterative development cycles.
