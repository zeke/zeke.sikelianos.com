Heroku is a platform that simplifies the process of deploying, running, and scaling web applications. I wore many hats at Heroku, including designer, engineer, product manager, and evangelist. I designed and implemented a full redesign of addons.heroku.com, Heroku's marketplace for cloud infrastructure providers, as well as other web properties like blog.heroku.com and help.heroku.com. In my last year with Heroku, I devoted my efforts to improving the Node.js development experience on Heroku by rewriting the build process from scratch, creating the [semver.io microservice](https://semver.io) for resolving Node versions, writing documentation and blog posts, answering support tickets, and representing the company by speaking at conferences and mentoring at meetups.
