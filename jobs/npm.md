npm is the package manager for JavaScript: a huge registry of over 150,000 open-source modules for building applications for node/io.js and the browser. During my time at npm, I oversaw a complete redesign and rebuild of the frontend and backend of the npmjs.com website, making it faster, cleaner, more information-dense, mobile-friendly, and more easily contributed to by the open source community.
