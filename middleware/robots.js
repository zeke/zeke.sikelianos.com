# The content signals and their meanings are:
# search: building a search index and providing search results (e.g., returning hyperlinks

#   AI-generated search summaries.
# ai-input: inputting content into one or more AI models (e.g., retrieval augmented generation,
#   grounding, or other real-time taking of content for generative AI search answers).
# ai-train: training or fine-tuning AI models.
