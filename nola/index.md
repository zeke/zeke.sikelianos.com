description: A list of some of my favorite spots in New Orleans
-->

In the summer of 2015, my wife Jenelle and I decided to move to New Orleans.
We'd visited before and felt a magical draw. So on a bit of a whim, we left
Oakland and headed out for the other side of the country with our two year old
son Cosmos in tow. We didn't know quite what to expect, but a change of scenery
sounded fun.

We only ended up staying in New Orleans for six months before deciding to move
back to sunny California (Southern, this time) to be closer to family as we
prepared to bring out second baby into the world.

Our stay was short, but in that six months we explored a bit and found some
cool places. Here's a list of the ones we can remember.

[Lebanon's Cafe](https://goo.gl/NUJUKZ) for middle eastern food. Gyros,
souvlaki, kebab, greek salad, dolmas. Try the famous iced tea.
