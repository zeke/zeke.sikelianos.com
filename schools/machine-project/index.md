Machine Project is a Los Angeles based not-for-profit arts organization and community event space producing cultural programming with the goal of inspiring audiences to become creatively active by imagining, participating and relating in new ways to the arts and sciences. Machine Project utilizes a range of techniques, such as informality, humor, and surprise, in order to make new, exciting and complex ideas accessible.

Machine Project offers courses in electronics, sewing, pickling, computer programming, car theft and so forth. While living in Los Angeles, I attended several of these classes, the most interesting being the one where we built a shipwrecked boat.

While living in Los Angeles in 2010, I attended several courses at Machine Project, notably the building of a shipwrecked boat, the [Sea Nymph](http://machineproject.com/2010/09/05/shipwrecked-boat/).
